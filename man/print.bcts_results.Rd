\title{Print Summary of bcts_results}
\usage{
\method{print}{bcts_results}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{bcts_results} containing the results of Type-I error and power simulations.
The object should include components such as \code{sim_type1} and \code{sim_power}, each containing simulation results.}

\item{...}{Optional additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A printed summary table displaying:
\itemize{
\item \code{statistic}: The name of the statistic being summarized.
\item \code{est}: The estimated value of the statistic.
\item \code{cil}: The lower bound of the 95\% confidence interval (or specified level).
\item \code{ciu}: The upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval (or specified level).
}
}
\description{
This function provides a detailed summary of an object of class \code{bcts_results}, which contains simulation results for an adaptive clinical trial.
It computes and displays key statistics such as Type-I error, power (with and without futility adjustment), probabilities of triggering futility or increasing sample size, and final sample size estimates.
}
\details{
The function extracts and summarizes important metrics from the \code{bcts_results} object:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Type-I Error}: The estimated Type-I error rate along with its confidence interval.
\item \strong{Power}:
\itemize{
\item Without futility adjustment: The power estimated without considering futility triggers.
\item With futility adjustment: The power adjusted for scenarios where futility was triggered.
}
\item \strong{Pr(fut.trig)}: The probability of triggering futility during the trial.
\item \strong{Pr(inc.ss)}: The probability of increasing the sample size during the trial.
\item \strong{N final}: The mean final sample size and its confidence interval.
}
